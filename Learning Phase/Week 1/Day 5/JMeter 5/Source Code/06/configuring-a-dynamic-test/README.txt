I have included the CSV file with the users of the application and the scripts of each demo in the module (including the home controller fragment).

To open them in JMeter, go to File -> Open.

Remember to install the plugin Custom Thread Groups (https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/ConcurrencyThreadGroup/) for scripts 05 and 06.
